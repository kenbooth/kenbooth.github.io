- The harbor at San Juan Bay is a hive of activity. There are cruise ships, sailboats, commercial ships, ferries, seaplanes and regular planes all moving about. If you have the opportunity, grab a coffee or cocktail and sit and watch.
- The cruise terminal docks are also a hive of activity of a different kind as vendors pitch services and wares.
- The oldest building in the United States, if not counting Native American structures, is in San Juan. The Cathedral of San Juan Bautista dates from 1521 (pictured above).
- The narrow, European-style streets along with the historic buildings and views of the waterfront make Old San Juan a treasure to walk through. You  can turn the corner and run into something like Capilla del Santo Cristo de la Salud (Chapel of Christ the Savior) from 1753.
- Some cities are overrun with pigeons. Old San Juan is overrun with cats _and_ pigeons. At Capilla del Santo Cristo de la Salud you will be offered bird seed for sale, but no cat chow.
- The men's room in San Felipe de Morro Fortress has a great view of the sea.
- At night the lights on surrounding hills and cruise ships make for a beautiful sight.
