![](/assets/images/41kVPZRuEgL-132x200.jpg)Rachel Kushner's new novel [_The Mars Room_](https://amzn.to/2FrAqfX) is a heartbreaking and unsparing look at a life gone sideways. From a young age Romy Hall became acclimatized to life on the street in San Francisco and seemed like someone who could navigate the fine line between survival and self-destruction. But a bad history with an obsessive strip club visitor leads the young mother to an unfortunate encounter and two life sentences in prison.

Separated from and unable to get in contact with her son, Hall tries to reconcile her new life with her old. Kushner draws a vivid picture of a woman growing up only knowing poverty and getting caught up in a system that has little regard for her plight.

_The Mars Room_ (Scribner, digital galley) alternates between the present and Hall's earlier life. While at times brutal, the novel offer an empathetic look at prison life and the rich cast of characters who reside there.
