From the first quarter of 2017 I recommend _Celine_ and _Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness._

Inspired by the life of his own mother, Peter Heller's _Celine_ is a heart-felt missing person story. Heller's previous books, _The Dog Stars_ and _The Painter_, are also worth reading.

Peter Godfrey-Smith's _Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea, and the Deep Origins of Consciousness_ uses the octopus as the launching pad for a discussion on evolution and consciousness. Godfrey-Smith's books offers a deeper understanding of various levels of intelligence in the animal world and better understanding of the human mind.

Below are all of the books I've read so far this year. Anything 4-stars or above is worth reading. I'd pass on all of the 3- and 2-star picks.
