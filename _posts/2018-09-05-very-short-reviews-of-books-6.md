A roundup of brief reviews of books I read in August. Looking back it was a good month. Depending on where your tastes lie, I'd recommend everything but _The Butcher's Boy_. But if I had to pick one, it would be _The Line Becomes a River_, which is a good look at what happens along our southern border and would be enlightening no matter where your politics are on immigration. 

**[The Line Becomes A River:](https://amzn.to/2oJlVhz)** Francisco Cantú's memoir of his years working as a border patrol agent and living along the Mexican border is an honest and timely book on immigration that doesn't get bogged down with rhetoric and politics. (5/5 stars.)

[**The Third Hotel:**](https://amzn.to/2CmJC99) After arriving in Cuba for a film festival, Clare spots her husband standing outside of a museum. The thing is, he most certainly died shortly before the trip. This is a haunting and surreal novel that explores the psychic toll of grief. (5/5 stars.) [Read my full review.](https://kenbooth.net/review-the-third-hotel/) 

[**Silence:**](https://amzn.to/2Q67lgA) Two Jesuit priests in seventeenth-century Japan find their faith tested by hostile feudal lords in this classic from 1966. (5/5 stars.)

[**The Line That Held Us:**](https://amzn.to/2wMjKyu) While trespassing to poach a deer, Darl Moody accidentally kills the brother of a notoriously vicious man. What transpires is like a tale from an earlier time ... a brutal frontier story of rash decisions, revenge and salvation. (5/5 stars.)

[**Darling Days:**](https://amzn.to/2PDXE8g) iO Tillett Wright's memoir of growing up in gritty New York with a temperamental mother prone to bad behavior.  (4/5 stars.)

[**Forty Autumns:**](https://amzn.to/2NUFzCA) A moving memoir of a German family that lived on both sides of the Berlin wall during the Cold War. (4/5 stars.)

[**Brother:**](https://amzn.to/2Q9Awjd) A young man in urban Toronto laments for his dead brother in this study on sorrow and survival. (4/5 stars.)

[**Drink Beer, Think Beer:**](https://amzn.to/2Nls2qi) An approachable homage to independent brewers. (4/5 stars.) [Read my full review.](https://kenbooth.net/review-drink-beer-think-beer/)

**[The Last Colony:](https://amzn.to/2oITdNV)** Book 3 of John Scalzi's _Old Man War_ series is the best to date and follows retired warriors John Perry and Jane Sagan as try to set up a colony on a new planet while dealing with politics and aliens. (4/5 stars.)

**[The Butcher's Boy:](https://amzn.to/2oHGvz1)** An overrated and uninteresting story of a hitman on the run. (2/5 stars.)
