While doing field research and trying to unlock a mystery from her childhood, anthropologist June Stefanov makes a startling discovery: For millennia automatons have lived among us, hiding their presence while trying to understand the nature of their own existence. But their time is drawing to an end and Stefanov may be a key, if unlikely, ally in their survival.

[_The Clockwork Dynasty_](http://amzn.to/2wBFw69) (Doubleday, digital galley) is a thrilling and original steampunk fantasy with a touch of Laura Croft thrown in. Daniel H. Wilson, the author of [_Robopocalypse_](http://amzn.to/2uOA7Xc) and _[Robogenesis](http://amzn.to/2vqPOrv)_, cleverly uses flashbacks to tell a story that develops over thousands of years. Considering the timespan the book covers, it moves at a breakneck pace and is hard to put down.

While _Robopocalypse_ was a cautionary tale about the danger of runaway artificial intelligence, _The Clockwork Dynasty_ is pure fantasy dealing with the familiar struggle of good vs evil. Wilson has proven repeatedly in his novels that he knows how to breathe life into the mechanical bodies of robots.

You can read interviews with Wilson discussing _The Clockwork Dynasty_ at [Syfy](http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/author-daniel-wilson-on-his-latest-novel-the-clockwork-dynasty) and [Unbound Worlds](http://www.unboundworlds.com/2017/08/clockwork-dynasty-robots-daniel-h-wilson/). Yesterday he was on Reddit [answering questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/6suaan/hi_reddit_this_is_daniel_h_wilson_i_wrote/) about all of his books.
