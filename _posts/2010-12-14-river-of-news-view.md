I have just published my effort at designing a [unique view](http://scripting.com/stories/2010/12/10/newViewsOfMyRiver.html) for Dave Winerâ€™s [River of News](http://daveriver.scripting.com/). Dave published his news river as JSONP, making it available via Javascript for modification. I know just enough about Javascript to modify a script someone else has written, so I have to thank Martin Duffy for graciously letting me grab his script and modify it for my effort.

If you find any bugs in the code or css for may page, please leave a comment below.

_Update:_ Martin Duffy [explains how he did it](http://martimedia.blogspot.com/2010/12/river-of-news-consuming-jsonp-data-feed.html).

_Update:_ My version of the River stopped functioning correctly and has been removed from this site.
