title: My reading habits have compeltely changed
---
I've read about 100 books each of the past four years, but I've found it hard to pick up and concentrate on a book during the COVID-19 crisis. I'm discovering I can read some more escapist books, so I'm turning to science fiction and mysteries to get by. It's the reading equivalent of passing on the brocolli and grabbing a carton of ice cream.
