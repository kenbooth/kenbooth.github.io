What started out as a novelty from a couple of visitors to [Shorpy](http://www.shorpy.com/) has grown into a rather large collection of [colorized photos](http://www.shorpy.com/image/tid/220). We now have 96 photos in the gallery and a few more in the wings waiting to be posted. It’s interesting that the first few colorized photos that were shared on the site inspired a number of other people to start taking a crack at it. The quality varies, but a number are quite well done. The comments on a few of the photos have also become heated as people attack or defend the practice of altering historic images. The consensus seems to be, “let people have some fun.”
