I joined Kenny Smith on [The Best Story I've Heard Today](https://beststory.podbean.com/) podcast to discuss the Vox story "[What smartphone photography is doing to our memories](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/3/28/17054848/smartphones-photos-memory-research-psychology-attention)."

We discuss research that shows the taking and sharing of smartphone photos is changing the way we remember experiences. Because of that, what we remember may not be an accurate version of events.

But the good news — in what may seem like a paradox — is that if used mindfully, cameras can actually enhance memories of certain experiences. The key is to understand what’s happening when you start taking pictures.
