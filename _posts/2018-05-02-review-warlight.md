![](/assets/images/51Fxy-n8MkL-136x200.jpg)In the aftermath of WWII 14-year-old Nathaniel and his sister are left in the care of a mysterious man they nickname The Moth and his possibly criminal cohorts.Â [_Warlight_](https://amzn.to/2KuZlD3) follows Nathaniel's adventures with this eccentric lot and his efforts to discover why his mother seemingly abandoned him.

This coming of age story is unfortunately a disjointed and at times confusing novel. During most of the book we're told his mother was involved with a secret government agency and that Nathaniel has heard stories about her war service. But these are only vague references for such a key plot point and we never get to hear those stories or discover their source.

_Warlight_ (Knopf, digital galley) was written by Michael Onjaaatje, who also wrote _The English Patient_, which was turned into a movie. His latest effort, however, is an opaque and enigmatic book that leaves too many questions unanswered.
