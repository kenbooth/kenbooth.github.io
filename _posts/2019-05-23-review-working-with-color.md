_[The Urban Sketching Handbook: Working with Color](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41162565-the-urban-sketching-handbook)_ [](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41162565-the-urban-sketching-handbook) is both instructional and inspirational. The book teaches how to use color to convey mood and emotions in urban sketches and should appeal to anyone looking for guidance and fresh ideas.

The book is packed with wonderful artworks and would be good to keep at hand just for the inspiration they provide. Author Shari Blaukopf does a thorough job of discussing how to pick, create and use palettes and gets into the specifics of mixing colors to create proper tone and emotions.

_Working with Color_ (digital galley, Quarry Books) does not, however, dive into the basic techniques of sketching and drawing. There are [other](https://www.goodreads.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=urban+sketching+handbook&search_type=books&search%5Bfield%5D=on) _Urban Sketching Handbooks_ for that. This book is best suited to those who consider themselves to be beyond the absolute beginner level who are interested in improving their use of color.
