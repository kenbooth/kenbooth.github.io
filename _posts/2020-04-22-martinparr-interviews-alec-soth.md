Martin Parr has a fairly new YouTube series in which he has casual conversations with photographers. In the most recent segment Parr [sits down with Alec Soth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUyzwFJe2-s), who discusses his beginnings as a photographer and his most recent work, _[I Know How Furiously Your Heart Is Beating](https://alecsoth.com/photography/projects/i-know-how-furiously-your-heart-is-beating)_.  

Toward the end of the discussion Soth touches on photo ethics and photographer guilt: "The biggest ethical problems come in, not in the making of the work, but in its distribution ... there's a lot of discussion about the ethics of photography, the ethics of photographing someone on the street. Really taking the picture of someone on the street isn't a problem, it's putting it on the internet or selling it in the gallery."<!--more-->
