![](/assets/images/durango-silverton.jpg)My wife and I were skiing at Purgatory in 1994 and rode the Durango & Silverton Railroad as a side trip. It’s well worth doing if you’re in that part of the country, particularly during the winter. The views of snow-covered mountains can’t be beat.This image is from a new scan from a 35mm photo taken during the trip. I was worried about how the scans would look, but I’m very happy with the results.

This image if part of a new project to digitize my photo library. I’m using a Plustek OpticFilm 7600i and VueScan software. The scanning application that came with the Plustek seemed a little buggy on the Mac. And if you read reviews online it seems like everyone ends up purchasing VueScan eventually because of its user interface.
