![](/assets/images/51byubQzJoL-132x200.jpg)The inscrutable auteur David Lynch has delivered a number of memorable films that enthrall and confuse viewers. In _[Room to Dream](https://amzn.to/2Nk4NKC)_ we get to peek behind the camera to see what drives the visionary director and artist.

In this autobiographical work that's a collaboration between Lynch and Kristine McKenna, the chapters alternate between interviews with more than 100 colleagues, friends and family and Lynch's own recollections of events. The biography ranges from stories of his growing up in a small western town to the processes that went into creating such iconic works as _Eraserhead_, _The Elephant Man_, _Blue Velvet_, _Wild at Heart_, _Twin Peaks_ and _Mulholland Drive._

Lynch was involved in even the smallest details of each of his works. He would often change directions on a whim if he felt it would serve the story and he was known to pull people from his production crew or even off of the street if he saw a roll for them in a film. Lynch's colleagues universally laud him as one of the kindest and most giving directors to have worked with. A number of artists interviewed for the book credit Lynch as having given them the chance that kick started their careers.

Other than _Dune_, Lynch has avoided projects that could be consider big-budget Hollywood movies. _Room to Dream_ (Random House, digital galley) is a refreshing look at someone who has pursued a singular vision and is willing to say "no" when his goals don't align with financial backers.
