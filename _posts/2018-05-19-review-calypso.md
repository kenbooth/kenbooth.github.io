![](/assets/images/41zfEb2HQcL-132x200.jpg)David Sedaris has mastered the ability to be dark, charming and funny at the same time. His latest collection of essays, [_Calypso_](https://amzn.to/2wTMO9z), revolves around gatherings at his North Carolina beach house, the Sea Section. Sedaris deftly handles a variety of topics including  middle age, shopping, gay marriage, language and family tragedy.

It's hard to go more than a couple of pages without belting out a laugh at some outrageous situation in which Sedaris has gotten involved. And he is capable of being shocking, as with a recurring tale that involves a homely snapping turtle and a tumor Sedaris needs removed

Sedaris' unique powers of observation and his intimate descriptions of  human interactions are absorbing. This is among his best books and fans will want to get hold of a copy. Anyone new to Sedaris' writing will find _Calypso_ (Little, Brown and Company, digital galley) a fine introduction to his achingly funny stories.
