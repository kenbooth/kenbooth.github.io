New York City police officer Barry Sutton gets wrapped up in a time-travel adventure while investigating the mysterious False Memory Syndrome, in Blake Crouch's _[Recursion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42046112-recursion?from_search=true)_. Along the way he crosses paths with neuroscientist Helena Smith, who discovered the secret held in people's memories and realizes the danger she has unleashed.

There is a sense of impending doom as reality as everyone knows it begins to unravel and every effort to right the course of history introduces new problems. I don't want to say more about the plot for fear of revealing a twist, but this is a fast-pace thriller that infuses fresh ideas into the time-travel genre.

Crouch has already written a number of successful thrillers, including _[Dark Matter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27833670-dark-matter)_ and the _[Wayward Pines](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15096164-pines)_ series, but this is his best novel yet. _Recursion_ (digital galley, Crown Publishing Group) deals nicely with the many paradoxes that inevitably crop up with time travel and Crouch wraps up everything neatly at the end.
