**This is a short review** of one of King's best recent novels, _[The Institute](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43798285-the-institute?from_search=true)_. The book explores relationships among children with "special talents" held and abused at a secret installation. This is a good-vs-evil story that's hard to put down.

**Brittany Howard is a pure joy** to watch perform. Her current tour ends in November and I hope she plans to do festivals next year so I have a chance to see her again live. Until then, there's an [NPR Tiny Desk Concert](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/15/768439696/brittany-howard-tiny-desk-concert) from this week to hold us over.

**I'm working on a longer review** of _[Janis: Her Life and Music](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45042225-janis)_, which will be released October 22. But for now it's enough to say go ahead and pre-order a copy. It's a well-researched and well-written page turner by Holly George-Warren.

**Listen to Janis Joplin** before Big Brother & the Holding Company in the 1964 bootleg "[Typewriter Tape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_dCnckBD34)" recording. Her talent shows as she sings with guitarist Jorma Kaukonen, while his wife types a letter in the background.

**It amazes me** that there is a subway station in the basement of the Old State House in Boston. It's not a big building and it's odd to walk out of the station and see where you are. You can see it here on [Google Street View](https://goo.gl/maps/fBAqeVpMwfz8oBmB7). Here it is the [1906 Old State House](https://www.shorpy.com/node/24864) with the subway, or East Boston Tunnel, entrance at the back left of the building. And before the subway in [the early 1890s](https://www.shorpy.com/node/6979), when the basement was occupied by a telegraph office.
