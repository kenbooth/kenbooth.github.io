There's a [wonderful interview](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/17/t-magazine/william-eggleston-photographer-interview-augusten-burroughs.html) in _The New York Times_ with pioneering photographer William Eggleston. He is refreshingly blunt and unendingly confident.

> “Oh, half of what’s out there is worthless,” he scoffs. “The only pictures I like are the ones I’ve taken.”

On having reservations about what he is photographing:

> “That doesn’t happen,” he says with firm authority. When he raises the camera to his eye it’s because he’s going to take a picture and the picture is going to work, the end. He either takes one photograph of his subject or no photographs of it. There is never a moment of internal consideration or indecision — there is only certainty — which explains why he has no favorites: “Each one, to me, is equal, or I didn’t take it to begin with.”

Upon being asked if he is a genius, "He replies in a breathy, almost pitying drawl, 'Well, yes.' The unspoken message is clear: You’ve spent all day with me and you even have to ask?"
