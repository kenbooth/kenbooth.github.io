On Sept. 2, 2017, I hiked the Walls of Jericho from the Alabama trial head in Jackson County, Alabama, with my brother in law and my dog. The hike is a strenuous 6 miles round trip and leads to the headwaters of the Paint Rock River. At the end of the hike is a large natural stone amphitheater which usually has at least a small flow of water running through it, feeding a series of waterfalls.

Parking for the trail is located on AL- 79, about 26 miles north of U.S. Highway 72. Drive past the horseback parking to get to hiker parking and the trail head.
