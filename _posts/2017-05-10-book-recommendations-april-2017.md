[_**The Fold**_](http://amzn.to/2qqSO5L) by Peter Clines ★★★★ A good sci-fi summer read that touches on teleportation and inter-dimensional travel.

[_**Fight Club**_](http://amzn.to/2q5z6t5) by Chuck Palahniuk ★★★★★ Palahniuk's 1999 debut holds up. I read it because it continues to be referenced in a variety of media.

[_**Blindness**_](http://amzn.to/2qqWuoa) by José Saramago ★★★★ A country is stricken by a plague of blindness in this parable, which is considered one of Saramago's signature works. This is a book that will keep you thinking after you've finished it.

[_**Night Train to Lisbon**_](http://amzn.to/2pyQ5Dg) by Pascal Mercier ★★★ The story of a magnetic Portuguese doctor living during the dictatorship of António Salazar. A lot of philosophy, which I enjoyed, but the narrative bogged down at points.

[_**The Lost City of the Monkey God: A True Story**_](http://amzn.to/2qqUwUv) by Douglas Preston ★★★★ A fascinating story of the search for a lost Honduran city, the politics of archaeology and the medical consequences of exploring in the tropics.

[_**A Man Called Ove**_](http://amzn.to/2pjU62b) by Fredrik Backman ★★★ I was disappointed in this story of a misunderstood, grumpy man with a hidden heart of gold, which felt derivative.

[_**The Final Day**_](http://amzn.to/2q2UeCC) by William R. Forstchen ★★★ If you read Forstchen's first two books, read this one to see how it ends. If you haven't, just read the first one, [_One Second After_](http://amzn.to/2q5Ot54), to learn what might happen after an Electro Magnetic Pulse attack on the United States.
