What would the world be like if Amazon ran everything: From housing to entertainment to food production? Rob Hart's new novel _The Warehouse_ gives a peak at that scenario with a thriller that explores a world governed with corporate diligence.

_The Warehouse_ \[digital galley, Random House\] is set in the near future where The Cloud runs most of the economy by employing, housing and feeding workers in an environment regulated by technology. Those who can't get jobs at The Cloud find themselves living in a dystopian world of chronic unemployment. But someone is suspicious of the corporation's success and has infiltrated one of its facilities to find out what's really powering the company's success.

Unfortunately there are too many holes in the plot and an incongruous ending made me question whether the bad guys were really that bad after all. And if so, what was the point of all of the sneaking around early in the book.
