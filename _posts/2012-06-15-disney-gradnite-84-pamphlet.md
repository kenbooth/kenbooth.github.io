I found this 1984 Disney Gradnite pamphlet while decluttering the house.

My wife and I were both students in Florida ant attended Disney's Gradnite '84 at the same time with our high schools. But we didnâ€™t meet until a few years later in college.

Performers were Night Ranger, Dazz Band, Dwight Twilley, Exile and "Weird Al" Yankovic.
