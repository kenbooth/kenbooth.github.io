Here is a roundup of the best reads from the week. These may not be new to the internet or you, but they were of fresh interest to me.

1. [Rent control needs retirement, not a comeback](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-07/rent-control-needs-retirement-not-a-comeback).
2. [Quincy Jones on Michael Jackson, his relationship with the Trumps, and the problem with modern pop](http://www.vulture.com/2018/02/quincy-jones-in-conversation.html).
3. [The life of Otha Porter Martin, a young miner photographed by Lewis Wickes Hine](https://morningsonmaplestreet.com/2018/01/22/otha-porter-martin-macdonald-west-virginia/). There is a great hi-definition [image of young Martin on Shorpy](http://www.shorpy.com/node/2336?size=_original#caption).
