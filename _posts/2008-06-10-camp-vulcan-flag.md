This flag, which flew over Camp Vulcan in Afghanistan, was presented to our office today by Mike Tomberlin, a Field Artillery Major in the Alabama Army National Guard, who just returned from a year-long tour in Afghanistan. Mike posted regular updates on his experiences in his [Yellowhammering Afghanistan](http://blog.al.com/afghanistan/) blog on al.com.
