title: "How to word graduation announcements for commencements canceled due to COVID-19"

School graduations are upon us and if you, like me, are ordering announcements you realize a few changes need to be made to the wording due to commencement ceremonies being canceled or postponed because of COVID-19.

In lieu of a commencement date and location you can just say the student will be graduating "in two thousand twenty." But I prefer the more specific, "at the conclusion of the spring semester two thousand twenty."

Because COVID-19 is a global event understood by everyone, you don't need to go into the specific details for the ceremony being canceled. Just leave the focus on the student and their achievement.

Here is a sample university announcement:

_The President, the Faculty  
and  
The Graduating Class  
of  
Auburn University  
College of Sciences and Mathematics  
Announce the Graduation of  
Jane Doe  
at the Conclusion  
of the Spring Semester  
Two Thousand Twenty  
with a  
Bachelor of Science Degree in  
Applied Mathematics_
