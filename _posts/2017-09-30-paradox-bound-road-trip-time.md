![Paradox Bound review](images/paradox-bound-132x200.jpg)When a book's description mentions time travel I'm usually hooked. And because I thoroughly enjoyed Peter Clines' _14_ and _The Fold_, I enthusiastically jumped into his latest, [_Paradox Bound_](http://amzn.to/2yGqE7z) (Crown Publishing, digital galley).

This science fiction adventure follows EliÂ  Teague, a young IT tech who has spent most of his life preparing for the chance that he might again run into a time traveling woman he first encountered as a boy. When she does reappear, he is ready and determined to learn more about her, setting off on a road trip across the country and through history.

I don't want to give away any of the plot, so I'll simply say the premise that drives this journey is a little silly for my taste. But putting that aside I enjoyed the time travel aspects of this book as well as the interplay between the two lead characters. The mechanism for traveling through time is rather original and fits nicely in this story, so I'll also leave it to readers to discover.

_Paradox Bound_ is a fun read that comes to a satisfying conclusion and, as the title promises, paradoxes add interesting twists to the plot.
