Street photographer Matt Weber spent three decades documenting life in New York City. He started by pointing his lens out of his cab window and in the years since he walked the streets catching poignant images of the city's inhabitants.

The documentary _[More Than the Rainbow](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K6KSKO2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00K6KSKO2&linkCode=as2&tag=zipreference-20&linkId=WKDPBIBYUWAA4FXB)_ takes a look at his work and includes interviews with New York photographers Ralph Gibson, Zoe Strauss, Todd Oldham, Eric Kroll, David Beckerman and Ben Lifso, exploring the boundary between street photography and art.
