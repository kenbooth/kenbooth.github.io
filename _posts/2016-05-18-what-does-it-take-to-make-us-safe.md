During the Olympics in Atlanta, and following the bombing in Centennial Olympic Park, my wife and I were among spectators made to stand in huge crowds outside of venues while the buildings were swept for explosives. While this exercise may have guaranteed the safety of the facilities it did nothing to protect those of us huddle in large, vulnerable crowds outside.

If I were standing in a security line at one of Chicago's airports I would not feel that the Department of Homeland Security and the TSA were trying to make me safe.
