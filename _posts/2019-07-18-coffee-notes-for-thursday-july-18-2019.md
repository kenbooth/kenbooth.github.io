**Self-driving cars** are [way in the future](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/business/self-driving-autonomous-cars.html?action=click&module=News&pgtype=Homepage): "Several carmakers and technology companies have concluded that making autonomous vehicles is going to be harder, slower and costlier than they thought."

**Gmail spam filters** have gotten worse. They used to be so reliable I could simply ignore my spam filter. Now I have so many false positives my spam has to be reviewed every day. Many of the emails sent to the folder don't have any obvious spam qualities and clicking "not spam" does nothing to keep subsequent emails from the same sender from being marked as spam.

**Despite recycling** the same monster and general plot, season 3 of _Stranger Things_ is my favorite so far. It may be because of all the 80s movie references.
