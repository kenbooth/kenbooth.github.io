I've put together a [development blog](https://boothlabs.com/testblog/) using [RapidWeaver](https://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/) plus the [Stacks](https://rapidweavercommunity.com/addons/plugins/stacks), [Foundry](https://rapidweavercommunity.com/addons/stacks/foundry) and [Alloy](https://rapidweavercommunity.com/addons/stacks/alloy) plugins. The development blog is just a test, but the design will be used as the framework for other projects. With RapidWeaver and its plugins it's pretty easy to quickly create fresh designs. I basically started with a blank slate and built up what I wanted. The test blog is based on [Scripting.com](http://scripting.com) and [Svbtle](http://svbtle.com).
