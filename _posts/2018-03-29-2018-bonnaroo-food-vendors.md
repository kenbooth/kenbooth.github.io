The Bonnaroo music festival has released their 2018 food lineup, but the list [on their site](https://www.bonnaroo.com/news/2018-food-lineup/) is hard to browse through without a lot of clicking. I've reformatted the list of food vendors below to make it easier to scan. Related: [Bonnaroo 2018 lineup spreadsheet](https://kenbooth.net/bonnaroo-2018-lineup-spreadsheet/).
