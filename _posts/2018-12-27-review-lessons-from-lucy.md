Pulitzer Prize-winning humorist Dave Barry is back with a collection of stories related to life advice learned from his beloved dog, Lucy. In _[Lessons From Lucy](https://www.amazon.com/Lessons-Lucy-Simple-Joys-Happy-ebook/dp/B07CL5PVDB/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1545920931&sr=8-1&keywords=lessons+from+lucy)_ Barry ties stories from his life to something he learned from his aging dog, such as "make new friends."

_Lessons From Lucy_ (digital galley, Simon & Schuster) contains Barry's familiar dry and self-deprecating humor, but the connections between his stories and the dog advice are flimsy at best. The life lessons are trite ("don't stop having fun") and seem like a gimmick to pull together this collection of anecdotes.

Unfortunately, as someone who has read and enjoyed a lot of Barry over the years, the stories related in this volume seem stale and recycled. Instead pick up an older Barry collection, or David Sedaris' recent [_Calypso_](https://kenbooth.net/review-calypso/) if you're looking for laugh-inducing humor. _Lessons From Lucy_ will be released April 2, 2019.
