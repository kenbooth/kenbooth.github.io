![](/assets/images/51dST3WMBaL-132x200.jpg)An intimate new biography of Robin Williams tells the story of the meteoric rise, frenetic life and the sad final days of the comedian. In [_Robin_](https://amzn.to/2Io5Av1), New York Times writer David Itzkoff gives us a look at the creativity that fueled Williams' seemingly spontaneous and endless comedic riffs. But he also tells of Williams' substance abuse, repeated infidelities, failed marriages and a manic anxiety over the quality of his performances.

Itkoff recounts stories of Williams' childhood, failed attempts at college, training at Juilliard and his early years on stand up comedy stages where he stood out among his peers. _Robin_ (Henry Holt & Company, digital galley) is well-researched and full of stories from family, friends and fellow comedians that cover both the highlights and the low lights of Williams' long career.

The story of Williams health decline and death is handled compassionately as Itzkoff tells of the depression, paranoia and confusion that Williams suffered from as a result of Lewy Bodies Dementia. And although Itkoff tries to give us a full measure of the man, even Williams' closest friends acknowledge he never revealed all of himself to anyone. In _Robin_ we may get the best look possible at comedic genius whose performances we know so well.
