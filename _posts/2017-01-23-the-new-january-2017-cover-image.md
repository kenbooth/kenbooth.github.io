The new header image was shot at the [Belle Chevre](http://www.bellechevre.com/) Cheese Shop and Tasting Room in Elkmont, Alabama. The shop was dog friendly and offered sandwiches, goat cheese and hand made fig ice cream.

The shop sits along the [Richard Martin Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Martin_Trail). If you start your hike south or north of town you can stop at the tasting room for lunch before heading back to your car.
