For some reason festivals don't provide schedules formatted for printing and I usually make my own printable Bonnaroo schedules. This year a couple of other people have done the heavy lifting already, so I'm sharing links here to the ones I've found. All of these were originally shared through the [Reddit Bonnaroo group](https://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/).

This printable Bonnaroo schedule [posted to Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/bbarap/bonnaroo_19_printable_pocket_schedule/) is my favorite. It's truly pocket size and is legible. You can also download the schedule as an Excel file [directly from Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h1zebfbqxcefrav/Bonnaroo%20printable%20pocket%20schedule%202019.xlsx?dl=0).

It's formatted to be laminated and shows where you can punch holes so that it can be mounted on a ring or carabiner (my plan).

You should also note that schedules can and usually do change. It looks like this one is being maintained and updated as things shift. But check back the week before to get what is hopefully an accurate schedule. You can also compare it to the [official Bonnaroo schedule](https://www.bonnaroo.com/schedule/).

This is probably the [most beautifully illustrated schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/bawe45/schedule_is_out/engnozh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). I don't love the black background for printing, but it is nice to look at.

Here is another schedule that was posted to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/bxj23c/updated_schedule_in_picture_format/). You can download it directly [from here](https://imgur.com/gallery/pOMMn8h).

This one is nicely color coded and each day looks like it would easily print on a sheet of 8 1/2 x 11 paper. This one was recently updated (as of 6/6/19) to reflect schedule changes. It would be wise to check any schedule you print for last minute changes.

This schedule was also [posted to Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bonnaroo/comments/bi2cpw/printable_schedule_thanks_to_uc_onner_for_the/), but won't fit as neatly in the pocket. But it does provide a better look at each day's lineup and would be a good one to have around camp. You can download it [directly as a jpeg](https://i.redd.it/yyap2kuxtuu21.jpg).
