A roundup of brief reviews of books I read in October. _Virgil Wander_ will probably make it to best books of 2018 list.

**[American Pastoral](https://amzn.to/2AQ1Htn)**: On the surface legendary high school athlete Seymour "Swede" Levov appears to be a simple, if boring man. But Philip Roth slowly reveals the many layers of the Swede's rather stormy life in this look at 1960s America. (4/5 stars.)

**[The Frolic of the Beasts](https://amzn.to/2DntvIp):**  A student is driven to an impulsive act of violence that forms the bond of an unusual love triangle in this translation of a 1961 Japanese classic. (4/5 stars.) [Read my full review](https://kenbooth.net/review-the-frolic-of-the-beasts/).

**[Rogue Protocol](https://amzn.to/2AQefRK):** Book three in The Murderbot Diaries series follows the gloomy protagonist robot as he continues to intervene in human affairs, despite a desire to just be left alone. (4/5 stars.)

**[Bridge of Clay](https://amzn.to/2ARdZ57):** The long awaited follow up from _The Book Thief_ author Markus Zusak is a disappointing and slightly muddled novel that jumps awkwardly back and forth in time to tell the story of five brothers growing up in Australia. (3/5 stars.)
