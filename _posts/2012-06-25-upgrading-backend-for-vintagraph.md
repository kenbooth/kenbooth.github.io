title: "Upgrading backend for Vintagraph"

I moved [Vintagraph](http://www.vintagraph.com/) to a new backend over the weekend. Itâ€™s a big change for us as it takes us from a blogging platform to one designed specifically for storefronts.

The site to this point has been made of hacks designed to make it perform like a store. Now we have a fully integrated shopping cart, products that can easily be sold across multiple categories and some new marketing tools to help us get products in front of buyers. It should be easier for shoppers to browse the wide range (~800) of prints we sell.

It has taken close to two months to get everything moved to the new platform. Plus over 48 hours for DNS changes to propagate, which was very frustrating, but everything is working this morning. Of course there are the usual launch bugs, such as photos not showing up in old blog posts, but that will get sorted out over the next week.
