It all starts with one college student falling asleep and not waking up. But the sleeping sickness quickly spreads through a small California town in Karen Thompson Walker's unique and authentic dystopian thriller _The Dreamers_.

As the story progresses the reaction of the characters feels frighteningly real. People panic in a grocery store, but still have time for helpful gestures; business men and women trapped in the town wander aimlessly and are thankful for a helping hand; a father goes to great lengths to protect his newborn child and college students first panic and then volunteer to assist with the sick.

If you've ever wondered how you might react in a crisis, you're likely to find some version of yourself among the characters in this novel. _The Dreamers_ (digital galley, Random House) is a refreshing and exhilarating addition to disaster fiction.
