Gallery owner Stephen Bulger gives an 11-part [video tour](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a6XSwG41ic) of "A Life in Photographs,” an [exhibition](https://www.bulgergallery.com/exhibitions/63-andre-kertesz-a-life-in-photographs/overview/) of André Kertész (1894-1985) images in Toronto. Each video is fairly short and they are a surprisingly intimate and captivating look at Kertész life and work.
