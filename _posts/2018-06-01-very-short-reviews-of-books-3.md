David Itzkoff's compassionate biography of Robin Williams stands out among the books I read in May. David Sedaris' wickedly humorous collection of essays is also worth picking up.

[**The Paris Wife**](https://amzn.to/2Jolfu2): Historical fiction written from the point of view of Ernest Hemingway's first wife, Hadley Richardson. Good for Hemingway fans, but so-so pacing. (4/5 stars.)

**[The Little Paris Bookshop](https://amzn.to/2LfTjFV):** This love story following a bookseller calling himself the literary apothecary was a little pretentious for my taste. (3/5 stars.)

[**Warlight**](https://amzn.to/2KuZlD3): In the aftermath of WWII 14-year-old Nathaniel and his sister are left in the care of a mysterious man they nickname The Moth and his possibly criminal cohorts. An opaque novel that leaves a lot of questions unanswered. (2/5 stars.) [Read my full review](https://kenbooth.net/review-warlight/).
