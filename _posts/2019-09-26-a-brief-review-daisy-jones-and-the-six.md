_[Daisy Jones & the Six](https://www.goodreads.com/book/photo/40597810-daisy-jones-the-six)_ [](https://www.goodreads.com/book/photo/40597810-daisy-jones-the-six) would have worked better, or just worked, as narrative fiction. The interviews in this oral history format overwhelm with minutiae and feel contrived. The format only serves to contrast this made-up rock band history with biographies of real rock bands. Just skip this and read the real thing. There's a [Janis Joplin biography](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43821567-janis?from_search=true) coming out in late October 2019. Or pick up one of the many books about Fleetwood Mac, on which this book is based.
