I created this piece of pop art circa 1979 for a school assignment. In the 1970s featuring cigarettes in a middle school assignment was completely acceptable.

Nobody in my household smoked so I'm not sure why I went with Marlboros, other than the fact that cigarettes were ubiquitous in the wider world and in 1970s advertising.

One of the poems in the book definitely dates this from the late 70s:

> Jimmy Carter was just a starter, but he won the elections without any rejections

I got an A-. Looking back, I believe this may have been the apex of my artistic output.
