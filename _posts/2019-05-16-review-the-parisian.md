Midhat KamalÂ dreams of his bright future as he travels to Paris during WWI to attend university, in _[The Parisian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40718380-the-parisian)_. While there the young Palestinian discovers love, loss and the bitter bite of prejudice.

After the war Kamal returns to a Palestine under British rule where he begins to learn his family textile business and start a family. But as political tensions erupt in the region, he can't help but be swept along in the flow.

Isabella Hammad has a beautiful writing style and has a lot of material to work with in _The Parisian_ (digital galley, Grove Press). Unfortunately the plot moves at a sluggish pace and the story often ebbs. If you have the time, Hammad's vivid descriptions and wonderful turns of phrase are enough to give this novel a chance.
