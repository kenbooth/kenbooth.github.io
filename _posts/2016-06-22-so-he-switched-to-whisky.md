> The day before he was due to go home Roger and I decided to have a word with Eric \[Clapton\]’s doctor about his drinking. We pleaded with him to tell Eric he mustn’t drink, explained the situation, told him how much he habitually drank, and how worried we were. The doctor told Eric it was fine to have the odd drink, but he wasn’t to drink a whole bottle of brandy. Eric saw this as the green light. He mustn’t drink a whole bottle of brandy…so he switched to whisky.
