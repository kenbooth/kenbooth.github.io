The original, and surreal, _Spaceman of Bohemia_ is highly recommended. _The Mars Room_ and _I am, I am, I am_ area also among my favorites from April.

[**The Mars Room**](https://amzn.to/2FbAIaX): A bad history with an obsessive strip club visitor leads a young mother to an unfortunate encounter and two life sentences in prison. This is a brutal, yet empathetic look at a life gone sideways. (5/5 stars.) [Read my full review](https://kenbooth.net/review-the-mars-room/).

[**I am, I am, I am**](https://amzn.to/2Fe9EaL): A remarkable and captivating memoir that recounts author Maggie O'Farrell's 17 near-death experiences.  (5/5 stars.)

**[The Immortalists](https://amzn.to/2HajYXf):** A family drama that follows the lives of four siblings who, as children, are told by a spiritualist the day they will die. (4/5 stars.)

**![Gateway to the Moon](images/61eWMuiJyqL._SY346_-134x200.jpg)[Gateway to the Moon](https://amzn.to/2qJ2gzc)**:  Mary Morris’ latest novel combines a coming of age story with historical fiction to explore ideas of identity and how history echoes across time. Set in a remote New Mexico town founded by crypto-Jews fleeing the Spanish inquisition. (4/5 stars.) [Read my full review](https://kenbooth.net/review-gateway-to-the-moon/).

[**Final Girls**](https://amzn.to/2qjoZRX): The "final girls" are a loose-knit trio of girls who were all lone survivors of mass murder. Now one of them is dead and the other two form a troubled bond in this psychological thriller. (4/5 stars.)

[**The Stars Are Fire**](https://amzn.to/2qhGn9Z): As Grace Holland reconciles the fact that she is in a loveless marriage, a fire breaks out in rural Maine and her husband disappears, and is assumed dead, while fighting it. Her chance at a new life is severely derailed after her husband returns disfigured. (3/5 stars.)
