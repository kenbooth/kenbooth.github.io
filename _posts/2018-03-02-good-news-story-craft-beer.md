I again had the pleasure of joining journalist and Indiana University Media Adviser Kenny Smith on [The Best Story I’ve Heard Today](https://beststory.podbean.com/) podcast. Today we discuss why the craft beer industry is thriving, based on this story from _The Atlantic_: [Craft beer is the strangest, happiest economic story in America](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/craft-beer-industry/550850/).

From 2008-2016 the number of craft breweries expanded by a factor of 6 and the number of brewery workers grew by 120 percent. The growth was fueled by a number of factors, including consumer tastes, support for local businesses, trendiness, social media and the falling cost of production equipment due to globalization.
