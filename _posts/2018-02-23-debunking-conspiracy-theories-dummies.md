I had the pleasure today of joining journalist and Indiana University Media Adviser [Kenny Smith](http://www.kennysmith.org/) to discuss conspiracy theories and how to debunk them on [The Best Story I've Heard Today](https://beststory.podbean.com/) podcast. The conversation is centered around the column "[how to test your favorite conspiracy theory](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-19/aliens-bigfoot-illuminati-do-conspiracy-theories-stand-up)" by Bloomberg writer and George Mason University Professor of Economics Tyler Cowen.
