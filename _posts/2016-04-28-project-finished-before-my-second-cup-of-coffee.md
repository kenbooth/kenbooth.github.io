I installed the [RainMachine Mini-8](http://amzn.to/1YVxHPW) on my home sprinkler system this morning. It was one of the easiest home improvement/tech projects I've ever done.

Replacing the old timer was very intuitive and can be done without reading the instructions. Getting the device up and running on my Wifi and connected to the iPhone app was also a breeze.

The beauty of this thing is it downloads weather data and only runs the sprinklers when it needs to. It automatically adjusts the amount of water it puts on the lawn based on recent and current weather events. This should reduce our water consumption. When I travel I'll also won't have to worry that my sprinklers are running on a rainy day.
