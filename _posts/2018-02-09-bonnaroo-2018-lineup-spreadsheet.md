I've updated the 2018 Bonnaroo lineup to include the performance date of each artist along with a link to their website. You can filter the **2018 Bonnaroo lineup spreadsheet** by date and category. You can also click on the tools dropdown to print or download the spreadsheet. **Related:** [2018 Bonnaroo daily schedules](https://kenbooth.net/bonnaroo-daily-schedules/) **Related:** [2018 Bonnaroo food vendors](https://kenbooth.net/2018-bonnaroo-food-vendors/)
