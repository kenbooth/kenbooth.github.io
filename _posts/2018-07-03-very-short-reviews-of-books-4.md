A round up of brief reviews of books I read in June. David Lynch's biography _Room to Dream_ and Stephen King's _The Outsider_ are new to bookstores and worth reading.

**[The Sun Also Rises](https://amzn.to/2tZ75pw):** Hemingway's first novel and one of his best works follows American and British expats traveling from Paris to the bullfights of Pamplona. (5/5 stars.)

**[Room to Dream](https://amzn.to/2tPtMgy):** A peek behind the camera to see what drives the visionary director and artist who has delivered a number of memorable films that enthrall and confuse viewers..(4/5 stars.) [Read my full review.](https://kenbooth.net/review-room-to-dream/)

![](/assets/images/51UQg72AiDL-1-134x200.jpg)[**The Outsider**](https://amzn.to/2tJwVi7): What starts as a murder mystery morphs into a familiar Stephen King creep-fest with a bogeyman channeling Pennywise from _It_. (4/5 stars.)

**[Angela’s Ashes](https://amzn.to/2NkiaKW):** I'm late to the game, but Frank McCourt's memoir of growing up poor in Ireland is as moving as everyone says it is. (4/5 stars.)

[**A Geek In Japan**](https://amzn.to/2NhPpy8): A fun, heavily illustrated and informative guide to the unique Japanese culture. (4/5 stars.)

**![](/assets/images/611XoE4ABdL-130x200.jpg)[The Stranger in the Woods](https://amzn.to/2u2FHaq):** A remarkable and revealing story of a man who lived as a hermit in the Maine woods for 27 years. (4/5 stars.)

**[Old Man's War](https://amzn.to/2KGrMRx):** In John Scalzi's science fiction novel, the elderly are given a chance at rebirth as part of humanity's interstellar fighting force. (4/5 stars.)

[**The Art of Map Illustration**](https://amzn.to/2yZodkK): Four artists share their techniques for mapmaking as well as samples of their work. While the book is full of beautiful maps, it seems more time is spent describing how to illustrate map embellishments such as trees and buildings.  (3/5 stars.)
