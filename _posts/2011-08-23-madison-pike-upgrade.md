![](/assets/images/madison-pike-upgrade.jpg)I’ve made a few design changes to [Madison Pike](http://www.madisonpike.com/) to give it a cleaner [Dave Winer](http://scripting.com/)\-like “River of News” appearance. The site is a news aggregator for Madison, Alabama and the new design cuts out extraneous design elements and does away with the larger blog-style headlines in favor of headlines nested within the paragraphs. I started with Automatic’s relatively new [P2 WordPress](http://p2theme.com/) theme and made a few modifications, including using Google Web Fonts for the masthead.

The P2 theme has a few nice features, including automatically rolling new stories onto the top of the page with a different color background and nested comments directly on the index page. I’m still trying to figure out how to successfully integrate Facebook Connect into this commenting system, which is a problem many people are struggling with.

I’ve also done some work on the back end and the site is now nearly 100% automated and crawls for news updates throughout the day.
