I've tried a couple of different times to install Jekyll on Macs, but I can never get it to run. The various cures found online are not effective and, honestly, it's not worth the effort if I can't get it to work correctly. I'm not confident I won't run into future problems. But, I've had good luck using it on HubSpot, so that's what I'm doing for now.
