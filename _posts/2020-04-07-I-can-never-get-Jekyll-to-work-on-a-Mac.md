title: Once again I can't get Jekyll to work on a Mac

I've tried a couple of different times over the years to install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on Macs, but I can never get it to run. The various online support cures are not effective and, honestly, it's not worth the effort if I can't get it to work correctly on install. I'm not confident I won't run into future problems. But, I've had good luck [using it on GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), so that's what I'm doing for now.
