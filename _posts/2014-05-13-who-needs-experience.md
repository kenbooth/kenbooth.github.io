A 24-year-old former wedding photographer is now [running Lonely Planet](http://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/The-25-Year-Old-at-the-Helm-of-Lonely-Planet.html), the world's largest publisher of travel guides.

Outside Magazine's Charles Bethea [says](http://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/The-25-Year-Old-at-the-Helm-of-Lonely-Planet.html), "I figured there had to be more to the story than 'reclusive billionaire hires 24-year-old with no known experience to run the joint,' but I think it's as silly as it sounds."
